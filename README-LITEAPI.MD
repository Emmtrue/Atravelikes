Getting Started With liteAPI
Learn how to quickly get up and running with LiteAPI. Follow these steps to start making API calls in minutes.

Step 1: Sign up

Create an account on the LiteAPI platform.
Obtain your API key from the dashboard.
Step 2: Authentication

Use your API key to authenticate your requests. See the Authentication section for more details.
Step 3: Making your first API call

Example code to fetch hotels by city:

JavaScript
Python
Go
PHP
Node

const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';

fetch('https://api.liteapi.travel/v3.0/data/hotels?countryCode=IT&cityName=Rome', {
    headers: {
        'X-API-Key': apiKey
    }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
Step 4: Explore the API

Browse the API Reference and Booking workflow to see all available endpoints and their functionalities.
Standard Authentication
All requests to LiteAPI must be authenticated using an API key. You can find your API key in the LiteAPI dashboard. An account provides analytics and management for all bookings through the attached API keys.

To authenticate against LiteAPI's REST APIs, include the X-API-Key header in your HTTP requests, setting its value to your personal API key.

This API key grants access to the API and must be kept confidential to prevent unauthorized use. Ensure you securely store the API key and avoid exposing it in public or client-side code repositories. This header ensures that your requests are authenticated and authorized to interact with LiteAPI's services.

Shell
Python
Go
PHP
Node

curl -X GET "https://api.liteapi.travel/v3.0/data/hotels?countryCode=IT&cityName=Rome" -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
Sample Sandbox API Key:

To help you get started quickly, we provide a sandbox API key that you can use for testing purposes. Note that this key has limited permissions and can only be used for sandbox testing. Sandbox API Key:


sand_c0155ab8-c683-4f26-8f94-b5e92c5797b9
Example Request Using Sandbox API Key:

Shell

curl -X GET "https://api.liteapi.travel/v3.0/data/hotels?countryCode=IT&cityName=Rome" -H "X-API-Key: sand_c0155ab8-c683-4f26-8f94-b5e92c5797b9"
Security Best Practices:

Keep your API key secure. Do not expose it in client-side code.
Rotate your API keys regularly.
Use environment variables to manage your API keys.
Secure Authentication
LiteAPI also provides a secure method for authenticating requests without directly transmitting your private API key. Instead, you can sign your request using HMAC SHA-512 and include the signature along with a public key in the request headers. This ensures better security by preventing your private key from being exposed in transit.

Why Use Secure Authentication?
When using API keys directly, they can be intercepted in transit, stored insecurely, or inadvertently exposed in logs. Instead, using a signed request ensures:

Enhanced Security: Your private API key never leaves your system.
Replay Attack Prevention: Each request includes a timestamp to prevent reuse of old signatures.
Integrity Assurance: The server verifies that the request has not been tampered with.
How It Works
Instead of sending your private API key, you generate a unique signature using your API key, a shared secret, and a timestamp. The server then verifies the signature to authenticate the request.

Steps:
Generate a UNIX timestamp.
Create a signature using HMAC SHA-512, combining your API key, shared secret, and timestamp.
Include the public key, signature, and timestamp in the request headers.
The server validates the signature and processes the request.
Example Implementation (JavaScript/Node.js)
JavaScript

const crypto = require("crypto");

const privateApiKey = "prod_123";
const publicApiKey = "prod_public_456";

const timestamp = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
const signature = crypto.SHA512(`${privateApiKey}${publicApiKey}${timestamp}`).toString(crypto.enc.Hex);

const authHeaderValue = `PublicKey=${publicKey},Signature=${signature},Timestamp=${timestamp}`;

const headers = {
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  Accept: "application/json",
  Authorization: authHeaderValue
};

console.log(headers);
Example HTTP Request
HTTP

GET /v1/data/hotels HTTP/1.1
Host: api.liteapi.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Authorization: PublicKey=123,Signature=abcdef123456789,Timestamp=1610000000
Error handling
LiteAPI uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

Here are the common status codes and their meanings:

200 OK: The request was successful.
400 Bad Request: The request was invalid or cannot be served.
401 Unauthorized: Authentication failed or API key is missing.
403 Forbidden: You do not have access to the requested resource.
404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found.
500 Internal Server Error: An error occurred on the server.

Example Error Response:

JSON

{
  "error": {
    "code": 400,
    "message": "Invalid city name."
  }
}
Handling Errors in Code:

Here's an example JavaScript script to handle errors when using our API endpoints.

JavaScript

fetch('https://api.liteapi.travel/v3.0/data/hotels?city=InvalidCity', {
    headers: {
        'X-API-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'
    }
})
.then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
        return response.json().then(error => Promise.reject(error));
    }
    return response.json();
})
.catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
});
Rate Limiting
To ensure fair use of resources, LiteAPI enforces rate limits on API requests. If you exceed the rate limits, you will receive a "429 Too Many Requests" response.

Rate Limit Details:

Sandbox API keys:
5 requests per second
Production API keys:
250 requests per second

Handling Rate Limit Responses:

JSON

{
  "error": {
    "code": 429,
    "message": "Too many requests. Please try again later."
  }
}
Contact us about custom rate limits if you need a higher rate limit.

Best Practices:

Implement exponential backoff when retrying requests.
Monitor your usage in the LiteAPI dashboard.

Build a fully-fledged web application to book hotels
We have created an open-source example web app using the LiteAPI Node.js SDK, available on GitHub. This example demonstrates the complete process of building a hotel booking website, including checkout, payment, and booking confirmation. Explore the source code here: https://github.com/liteapi-travel/build-website-example
Implementing Payment
Ready to handle payments with liteAPI? We‚Äôve got you covered with four built-in payment options, plus the flexibility to add your own payment layer if needed. Let‚Äôs dive into the options and how to get started with each one.

1. User Payment
Use liteAPI's payment SDK to accept user payment. User Payment Guide

This is the most common option, allowing liteAPI to handle all the payment processing on your behalf.

2. Account Credit Card
Pay directly from the account‚Äôs credit card. Account Credit Card Guide

This is the easiest method to implement, especially for sandbox testing. It's also used when an application wants to be the merchant of record or to bundle services or goods.

3. Account Wallet
Prepay to top up the wallet and then use the wallet funds for bookings. Account Wallet Guide

It is very similar to the Account Credit Card but offers the option to prepay for future bookings.

Retrieve rates for hotels
post
https://api.liteapi.travel/v3.0/hotels/rates
This endpoint allows developers to retrieve detailed rate information for hotels, supporting multi-room bookings. By making a POST request with the required parameters, you receive an array of offers, each containing comprehensive rate details. This endpoint is essential for providing users with detailed booking options, including pricing and room specifications.

The default request limit is 200 hotels per request. However, the limit parameter can be increased to accommodate up to 5,000 hotel IDs if needed. The recommended timeout is 6 seconds, but we recommend setting it to 12 when you have a high load. The required parameters include check-in and check-out dates, currency, guestNationality, and a location specified either by hotel-id, city, country, (latitude, longitude, radius), or placeId/iataCode, as well as an array of occupancy objects. Each occupancy object defines the number of adults and the ages of any children for each room requested, allowing for flexible booking scenarios.
