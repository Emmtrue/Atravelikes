Is it good for my case?
AeroDataBox is a niche enthusiast-driven aviation and flights API with certain limitations that we openly communicate. We do our best to under-promise and over-deliver. But is an enthusiast-driven API good for your case anyway? That depends!

If you‚Äôre developing a small or medium business (SMB / SME) or an application developer who does not require a tough service-level agreement (SLA) or an exhaustive worldwide coverage, our API is just right for you! However, at this point we discourage (and even do not allow in some cases) using our API for mission-critical or enterprise-level products where people may be hurt or severe damage can occur if the API fails for any reason.

Having said that, we‚Äôre are working hard to improve this. We expect to implement SLAs and direct access to our API and other data services with extra stability and high availability under special premium terms soon. Read more in our FAQ.

If you need it earlier or should you have special needs, please do contact us and tell us your story! We already have a record of implementing custom solutions tailored for needs of our customers.

Support
For direct contact, please reach out to us via e-mail at info@aerodatabox.com.

Before sending a message, please take some time to review the documentation and must-read website pages (at least data coverage and FAQ). These pages address roughly 80% of the questions we receive on day-to-day basis.

Aircraft API


GET
/aircrafts/{searchBy}/{searchParam}
Single aircraft (by tail-number, Mode-S or ID) [TIER 1]


Returns: Single aircraft, best matching specified search criteria, if found. Please note that all found aircraft will be impersonated with registration information matching the requested tail number or Mode-S even though an aircraft might be flying under a different registration right now.

Parameters
Try it out
Name	Description
searchBy *
string
(path)
Criteria to search aircraft by

Available values : Id, Reg, Icao24


Id
searchParam *
string
(path)
Value of the search criteria. If searchBy is:

id: then this field should be an ID of an aircraft (as specified in the database of this API);
reg: then this field should be a tail-number of an aircraft (with or without spaces or dashes, any case formats are acceptable, e.g.PH-BXO, DeMhJ), multiple matches are possible - see below;
icao24, then this field should be a ICAO 24-bit Mode-S address of an aircraft specified in hexadecimal format (e.g. 484161, 483EFD), multiple matches are possible - see below.
If multiple matches are possible:

There cannot be more than one aircraft actively flying with the same tail-number or ICAO 24-bit Mode-S address at any moment of time. However, historically aircraft tail-numbers or addresses may be used multiple times by different aircraft. This endpoint is supposed to return a single aircraft data. In case if multiple aircraft satisfy the search criteria, the best match will be chosen as follows:

If an active aircraft is found according to the requested critera, it is returned.
Otherwise, an aircraft that used requested tail-number/address the most recently is returned.
If usage time may not be determined, the aircraft stored in the database the most recently is returned.
searchParam
withImage
boolean
(query)
Should include aircraft image (default: false).

Default value : false


false
withRegistrations
boolean
(query)
Should include the history of aircraft registrations (default: false).

POST
/aircrafts/recognize/beta
Aicraft image recognition (BETA) [TIER 3]


What aircrafts are depicted on this photo?

This endpoint recognizes aircrafts on uploaded image and returns information about all detected aircrafts. It is based on computer vision technology and therefore results may be imprecise. It relies on detecting aircrafts' registrations and, once detected, attempting to match these registration with records in aircrafts database.

Returns: Data about found and recognized aircrafts.

Parameters
Try it out
No parameters

Request body

multipart/form-data
photo *
string($binary)
Image containing aircraft. It should be image-type file (JPEG, PNG or BMP).

To improve results:

ensure that aircraft registration is as much as possible visible on the image;
other inscriptions are visible as least as possible or absent on the image (although algorithm strives to filter these out as much as possible, false results are still possible).

Flight Alert API


POST
/subscriptions/webhook/{subjectType}/{subjectId}
Create web-hook subscription [TIER 4]


This endpoitns is a part of Flight alert PUSH API currently powered by webhooks.
If you are running your own web service, you can subscribe to flights by number or airport code. After that, your HTTP endpoint will be called (notified) whenever the flight information gets updated.

Creates a web-hook subscription on a subject (e.g., flight alerts by number or by airport code). Returns information about created subscription. Subscription ID contained in it can be used to refresh or remove it.

If subscription contains an expiration date-time, it will auto-expire automatically on this time. If you want to prevent expiration, use webhook/{subscriptionId}/refresh endpoint to refresh the subscription.

Every time a subject gets updated, a HTTP request will be sent to the URL specified in url parameter. Request will be of a POST type and contain JSON-formatted FlightNotificationContract object containing subscription and flights information in the body (see example response for status code 199 of this endpoint documentation).

All flight alerts / notifications are delivered in best-effort manner. They might be missing or delayed. If there was an error delivering a notification for any reason, there will be 2 more retries after 5 and 15 minutes (precise numbers might change).

If subscribed to a specific flight or to flights operated in a specific airport:

Ensure that the flight is within the live updates / ADS-B data coverage. There is no sense in subscribing to a flight which operates in airports having poor or no live updates or ADS-B coverage: there simply will be no updates. To check if an airport is tracked and on which level, use /health/services/airports/{icao}/feeds endpoint. You can also use /health/services/feeds/{service}/airports to get the list of covered airports. Read more about coverage here: https://www.aerodatabox.com/data-coverage.
Notifications will cover updates for flights commencing from 6 hours ago up to 72 hours in future.
Among these, notifications will contain only those flight items which were actually updated this time.
Parameters

Flight API


GET
/flights/{searchBy}/{searchParam}
Flight Status (single day) [TIER 2]


What is the status of a specific flight? What is the historical status or schedule of a specific flight on a specific date in past or in future?

This endpoint returns data about a specific flight live flight status (if the flight is within the coverage and not in distant future), or flight schedule data otherwise.

If dateLocal is specified, gets data about flight(s) departing or arriving on the day specified (local time). Otherwise, gets data about the status of flight(s) operating on the nearest date (either in past or in future).

A flight can be searched by:

flight number it's being operated under; or
ATC-callsign it's being operated under; or
tail-number of the aircraft it's being operated by; or
Mode-S 24-bit ICAO Transponder address of the aircraft it's being operated by.
Flight data may include airport of arrival and departure, scheduled and actual times, flight status, type of aircraft, tail-number and aircraft image.

Some flights may have partial data. The data may be absent for either arrival or departure airport or may not include live updates of time and status. Check quality markers inside the response to determine which data is available.

Normally, information with live status updates and estimated/actual arrival/departure times is only available for airports tracked live or with ADS-B by our system. Otherwise flight information will be with scheduled info only or absent.

To check if an airport is currently tracked and on which level, use /health/services/airports/{icao}/feeds endpoint. You can also use /health/services/feeds/{service}/airports to get the list of covered airports.

Read more about coverage and flight data limitations here: https://www.aerodatabox.com/data-coverage.

Aircraft images are being searched in external sources by certain criteria without any manual intervention. Therefore, false matches may be returned. Only images with licenses approved for commercial use are returned. Please be advised that you may be required to mention author attribution before using the image.

Mode-S 24-bit ICAO Transponder address of the aircraft it's being operated by.
Flight data may include airport of arrival and departure, scheduled and actual times, flight status, type of aircraft, tail-number and aircraft image.

Some flights may have partial data. The data may be absent for either arrival or departure airport or may not include live updates of time and status. Check quality markers inside the response to determine which data is available.

Normally, information with live status updates and estimated/actual arrival/departure times is only available for airports tracked live or with ADS-B by our system. Otherwise flight information will be with scheduled info only or absent.

To check if an airport is currently tracked and on which level, use /health/services/airports/{icao}/feeds endpoint. You can also use /health/services/feeds/{service}/airports to get the list of covered airports.

Read more about coverage and flight data limitations here: https://www.aerodatabox.com/data-coverage.

Aircraft images are being searched in external sources by certain criteria without any manual intervention. Therefore, false matches may be returned. Only images with licenses approved for commercial use are returned. Please be advised that you may be required to mention author attribution before using the image.

/flights/airports/{codeType}/{code}/{fromLocal}/{toLocal}
FIDS (airport departures and arrivals) - by local time range [TIER 2]


What are current departures or arrivals at the airport? or What is the flight schedule at the airport? or What is flight history at the airport?

Flights may contain live updates with corresponding information related to the actual progress of the flight (including actual/estimated arrival/departure times). In this case this endpoint serves as a FIDS endpoint. Presense of live updates is subject to data coverage: not all airports have this coverage in our system.

Otherwise flight information will be limited to scheduled only and will not be updated real-time. Much more airports have this type of coverage. To check if airport is tracked and on which level, use /health/services/airports/{icao}/feeds endpoint. You can also use /health/services/feeds/{service}/airports to get the list of supported airports for this or that layer of coverage. To learn more about the data coverage, refer to https://www.aerodatabox.com/data-coverage.

Returns: the list of arriving and/or departing flights scheduled and/or planned and/or commenced within a specified time range for a specified airport.

GET
/airports/{codeType}/{code}/stats/routes/daily
Airport routes and daily flight destinations [TIER 3]


What are the most popular routes from an airport? or Where I can fly from an airport? or How many daily flights to different destinations from an airport?

The data will only be available for airports which have at least schedules information available. If the airport is also covered with live or ADS-B coverage, the quality will improve greatly as it will be based on real data rather than on static scheduled data. To check if an airport is tracked and on which level, use /health/services/airports/{icao}/feeds endpoint. You can also use /health/services/feeds/{service}/airports to get the list of covered airports.

At the moment airports having both ICAO and IATA code and flight schedules are present available only.

Returns: List of routes and daily flights amount departing from an airport.
